# palettes

**Pure-Python, zero-dependency color palette toolkit**

`palettes` provides pre-computed, display-ready and integer-indexed color lookup tables for any Python environment. It has **zero dependencies** on any other PyDevices library or external package — the Quick Start below runs on a bare Python with nothing else installed. See [Support and platforms](#support-and-platforms) for where it is proven to run.

### Universal Color Tooling
While `palettes` integrates seamlessly with PyDevices displays, it is a standalone utility useful for **any Python project** needing easy-to-access named and indexed palettes, including:
- **Embedded & Hardware**: RGB565 displays, addressable LEDs / NeoPixels, status indicators.
- **Terminal & CLI Tools**: ANSI terminal formatting, logs, status alerts.
- **Data & Charts**: Consistent categorical and sequential color mapping.
- **Theme Engines**: Swappable UI color palettes with human-readable color names.

## Palette Types & Previews

### 1. Color Wheel (`"wheel"`)
Generates a smooth, continuous HSV-based color spectrum. Ideal for color pickers, circular progress rings, and continuous gradient animations:

```python
from palettes import get_palette

# 360-step full saturation color wheel (16-bit RGB565)
wheel = get_palette(name="wheel", length=360, saturation=1.0, color_depth=16)
color = wheel[180]  # get color at hue angle 180°
```

### 2. Material Design (`"material_design"`)
A curated collection of modern UI colors based on Google's Material Design palette:

```python
material = get_palette(name="material_design", color_depth=16)
primary_color = material.RED_S500     # shades are attributes: <FAMILY>_S<shade>
accent_color  = material.BLUE_A400    # accents: <FAMILY>_A<shade>
```

### 3. Color Cube (`"cube"`)
A structured 3D RGB color cube mapped into a discrete indexed palette. Excellent for retro imaging and color-space mapping:

```python
cube = get_palette(name="cube", size=5, color_depth=16)
```

### 4. Named Windows-16 (`"default"`)
The classic 16 standard system colors:

```python
win16 = get_palette(name="default", color_depth=16)
navy = win16[1]  # Black, Navy, Blue, Green, Teal, Lime, Cyan, etc.
```

## Quick Start

Nothing but `palettes` — this runs as it stands, on any of the four runtimes:

```python
from palettes import get_palette

# A 360-step colour wheel, ready to write to an RGB565 display
wheel = get_palette(name="wheel", length=360, color_depth=16)
print("red, green, blue as RGB565: 0x%04X 0x%04X 0x%04X" % (wheel[0], wheel[120], wheel[240]))

# Named colours, by attribute
win16 = get_palette(name="default", color_depth=24)
print("RED is 0x%06X, and its name back again is %r" % (win16.RED, win16.color_name(12)))

# Material Design, 0xRRGGBB
md = get_palette(name="material_design", color_depth=24)
print("Amber 500 is 0x%06X" % md.AMBER_S500)
```

```
red, green, blue as RGB565: 0xF800 0x07E0 0x001F
RED is 0xFF0000, and its name back again is 'Red'
Amber 500 is 0xFFC107
```

### Painting on a display

Put those values on a screen and you need a display driver, which `palettes`
deliberately does not depend on. `board_config` is not installable from here —
it is a per-board file you copy onto the device from
[pydevices/board_configs](https://github.com/PyDevices/pydevices/tree/main/board_configs),
or that `pydevices-desktop` provides on a desktop:

```python
import board_config          # from PyDevices/pydevices, not from palettes
from palettes import get_palette

display_drv = board_config.display_drv
palette = get_palette(name="wheel", length=display_drv.width, color_depth=16)

# Draw a full-width color spectrum band
for x in range(display_drv.width):
    display_drv.fill_rect(x, 0, 1, 40, palette[x])

display_drv.show()
```

## Installation

```python
import mip
mip.install("palettes", index="https://PyDevices.github.io/mip")
```

```bash
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ \
  --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ pydevices-palettes
```

`pydevices-palettes` is also parked on production PyPI, so a plain
`pip install pydevices-palettes` succeeds — one release behind. TestPyPI is the
current channel; use the command above.

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PyDevices/palettes && cd palettes
pip install -e .                                  # or just PYTHONPATH=lib
PYTHONPATH=lib python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
ruff check lib tests scripts
```

Those last two are what CI runs, so they cannot drift silently.

## Support and platforms

`palettes` is one pure-Python source tree with no runtime branches — the same
files run everywhere. What differs is the proof, labelled here with the org's
[platform support tiers](https://github.com/PyDevices/.github/blob/main/docs/platform-support-tiers.md):

| Runtime | Tier | What backs it |
|---|---|---|
| CPython (desktop/server) | CI-proven | `ruff` and the unit tests run on ubuntu CPython 3.13 on every push |
| PyScript / WebAssembly | bench-proven | The [live demo](https://palettes.readthedocs.io) on the docs site executes in the browser |
| MicroPython | community-verified | Ships via MIP and is used by pdwidgets on the boards, but nothing in this repo proves it automatically |
| CircuitPython | community-verified | Same source, same expectation, and the same absence of a CI job |

The two community-verified rows have one cause: there is no MicroPython or
CircuitPython job in this repo's workflow. Adding one is the cheap way to
promote both, since the library imports nothing.
